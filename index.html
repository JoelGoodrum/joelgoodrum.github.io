		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>My name is Joel Goodrum. I was born in Brazil a town called "Londrina" which means little london. Since I was a young child, I loved video-games. My love for video games steered me towards loving computers. Front-end developement is what I have been currently working on the most. But I have worked with gaming 3d engines, graphic design on photoshop, music with digital audio workspaces like froot loops and etc.</p>
