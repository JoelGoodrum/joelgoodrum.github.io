			<h1>BIO</h1>
			<p>Born in Brazil in a city called Londrina. Londrina means Little London. Since I was a young child, I loved playing video-games. My love for video games steered me towards being curious about computers. My first contact with programming was through a computer science course at Georgia State. In this course we learned how to manipulate data with Java. Recently, I have been working on software development with JavaScript, html and CSS. I have worked with a variety of tools outside of academia. Android Studio, a software I have used to code basic mobile applications in Java. Unity, a game engine where I had to code basic logic in C#. Blender, a game engine which I use mostly for 3d modeling. Photoshop,  a graphic design software where I have used to design logos. FL Studio, a music composition and editing software where I have composed instrumentals and edited sound effects. </p>

			<h2>Graphing Calculator</h2>

			<p>Software that allows user to input functions in the form y = x. The software outputs the y values and plots them on a graph. The software plots thousands of individual points giving the illusion that the graphs are curved or straight lines. This software plots precisely 14000 dots in less then half a second. Graphing Calculator was written in JavaFX using the JavaFX library.

But there are only three operation rooms available. The patients will be allocated to the operation room based on when they checked in and by their assigned priority.</p>

			<h2>CarApp</h2>
	
			<p>CarApp is a program where the user can navigate a list of cars. When the user clicks on the type of car, the page shows the options available for that type. The user then can click on a specific model. After the user clicked on a model, the details of the car will show up. CarApp runs only on computers. Everything was coded in pure Java.</p>
