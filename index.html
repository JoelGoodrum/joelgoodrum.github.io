			<h1>Bio</h1>
			<p>My name is Joel Goodrum. I was born in Brazil in a city called Londrina. Londrina means Little London. Since I was a young child, I loved playing video-games. My love for video games steered me towards being curious about computers. My first contact with programming was through a computer science course at Georgia State. In this course we learned how to manipulate data with Java. Recently, I have been working on software development with JavaScript, html and CSS. I have worked with a variety of tools outside of academia. Android Studio, a software I have used to code basic mobile applications in Java. Unity, a game engine where I had to code basic logic in C#. Blender, a game engine which I use mostly for 3d modeling. Photoshop,  a graphic design software where I have used to design logos. FL Studio, a music composition and editing software where I have composed instrumentals and edited sound effects. </p>

			<h2>Graphing Calculator</h2>

			<p>In this program, one can write equations in the format y = x. The program calculates the
			value of y for each input of x and plots it on the screen. Each row has total of 14-unit squares. Each square has about 25 pixels. The program converts unit squares into pixels and plots individual points for each pixel. The program's precision
			goes a little beyond one pixel per dot. it calculates precisely 14000 points in less than half a second. This program was written with Java using the JavaFX library.

			<h2>CarApp</h2>
	
			<p>CarApp is a program where the user can navigate a list of cars. When the user clicks on the type of car, the page shows the options available for that type. The user then can click on a specific model. After the user clicked on a model, the details of the car will show up. CarApp runs only on computers. Everything was coded in pure Java.</p>
