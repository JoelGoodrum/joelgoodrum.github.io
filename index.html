			<h1>Bio</h1>
			<p>My name is Joel Goodrum. I was born in Brazil a town called Londrina which means little london. Since I was a young child, I loved video-games. My love for video games steered me towards loving computers. Front-end developement with JavaScript and html is what I have been currently working on the most. But I have worked with gaming 3d engines, graphic design on photoshop, music with digital audio workspaces like froot loops and etc.</p>

			<h2>GraphingCalc</h2>

			<p>GraphingCalc is a simple graphing calculator that was written in Java. In this program, one can write equations in the format y = x. To write the functions, one must go to line 53 in the source code and change the values that effect x. A set amount of pixel was set to equal the distance of 1 on both x and y axis. The program begins ploting values from the left corner of the screen and prints for each new value after shifting 1 unit on the graph. </p>
